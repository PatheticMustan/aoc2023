# Day 2

## Part 1

For this one, most of it was just input processing.

All it is is getting the max of each color, then checking the final condition `(red <= 12, green <= 13, blue <= 14)`.

## Part 2

My code for part 2 was exactly the same, but this time you multiply all the colors together `(red*green*blue)`.
